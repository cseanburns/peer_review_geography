# Notes on language selection

## Human Development index scores from here:
### http://hdr.undp.org/en/countries accessed on May 27, 2016

- Caymen Islands is not listed, since it is a British Territory, we use the
  United Kingdom index.
- Martinique is a territory of France, so we use the France index.
- Monaco is an independent country, but does not have a HDI, so we use France,
  its closest neighbor.
- New Caledonia is a part of France, so we use the France Index.
- Puerto Rico is part of the US, so we use the US index.
- Svalbard and Jan Mayan is part of Norway, so we use the Norway index.
- Taiwan is counted as China.
- French Guiana uses the France index.

## Languages taken CIA World Handbook:

Languages are listed in rank order by country. If English is listed as an
official language, despite the rank order, then English is selected. If the
country is not listed, then an alternate site is used. Alternate sites for the
following countries are listed below:

- Cameroon people speak over two dozen African langauges (no dominant
  language), but English is listed as one of the official languages, so I put
  English.
- French Guiana -- French from Wikipedia (5/31/2016)
- Ghana lists English as an official language, and so that language is used.
- India -- English
- Martinique -- French from Wikipedia (5/31/2016)
- Namibia -- English
- Norway lists two versions of Norwegian: Bokmal Norwegian (official), Nynorsk
  Norwegian (official). I reduced to Norwegian.
- Rwanda -- English.
- Sri Lanka -- English has special status in the gov's constitution.

## Corresponding author note in author_decisions.csv

*n* signifies no corresponding author on the cover page -- I converted this to
the number "2" for proper data classification for R. So, "2" signifies no
corresponding author identified.
